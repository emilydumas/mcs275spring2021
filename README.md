# MCS 275 Spring 2021

Code and related materials shared with students in MCS 275 in Spring 2021 at UIC.

Students in the course are directed to this repository to view or download Python source files (`.py`) containing sample code, including code written during lectures.

Some course documents (e.g. worksheets and quizzes) are also stored here as Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) files.  These are not distributed to students using GitHub links; instead, HTML versions of these notebooks are hosted on the course web page.
