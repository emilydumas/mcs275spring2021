    "\n",
    "Write a function `double_letters_basic(text)` that accepts a string `text` and counts the number of instances of a character in that string being equal to the one after it.  It should return the count as an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, it doesn't matter whether the character is a letter or not, and runs of more than two copies will be counted multiple times.  Thus, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"aardvark\")` returns 1 because of the `aa` at position 0\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"space wasps---most of whom are not hostile!!\")` returns 3 because of the `--` at position 11, the `--` at position 12, and the `!!` at the end\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"the raccoon nook keepers in Mississippi cooked the books\")` returns 9\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"Oolong\")` returns 0 because it has no repeated characters; the initial `O` and subsequent `o` are not the same character.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your function, put it into a script that runs in on these test strings, prints the results, and then also waits for the user to enter a string in the terminal (using `input()`) and counts double letters in that string as well."

It has a constructor that takes two integer arguments, `x,y`, which are integer coordinates of its initial position that are stored as attributes.
