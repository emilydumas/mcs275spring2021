    "### 1. Kelvin temperature classes\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kelvin temperature scale is one where the temperature of 0K (0 Kelvins) represents absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature.  One Kelvin is the same size as one degree celsius, 0K is about -273.15°C.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't really make sense to add two temperatures; doing so would be a bit like adding one student's score on a quiz to another student's score on that quiz.  You could come up with a scenario where that's the right thing to do, but in most cases, the answer would not have any direct meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the ratio of two temperatures is meaningful, and has no units.  100K divided by 50K is equal to 2, which represents the ratio of average kinetic energies of the particles of an object.  Similarly, it does make sense to multiply temperatures by numbers; for example, multiplying a temperature by 2 answers the question \"If I doubled the average kinetic energy of each particle in this object, what would its new temperature be?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(One reason for using Kelvins here is that multiplication of Kelvins is meaningful, whereas multiplication of Celsius or Fahrenheit degrees is not.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use operator overloading to make two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* class `Temperature` to represent a temperature measured in Kelvins, given as a nonnegative float\n",
    "  * The constructor should expect one argument, a float, that specifies the temperature in Kelvins.\n",
    "  * Printing a `Temperature` object in the REPL or with `print()` should show something like `301.5K`  \n",
    "  * Taking the difference of two `Temperature` objects gives a `TemperatureDifference` object\n",
    "  * Multiplication of a `Temperature` by an int or float gives another `Temperature`\n",
    "  * Dividing one `Temperature` object by another `Temperature` object gives a float\n",
    "  * Equality testing is supported; is only equal to another instance of `Temperature` with the same number of Kelvins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* class `TemperatureDifference` to represent the difference between two `Temperature` objects\n",
    "  * The constructor should expect one argument, a float, that specifies a temperature difference in Kelvins (which may be positive, negative, or zero)\n",
    "  * Printing a `TemperatureDifference` object in the REPL or with `print()` should show something like `301.5K difference`\n",
    "  * Addition or subtraction of two `TemperatureDifference` objects gives another `TemperatureDifference` object\n",
    "  * Addition ot a `TemperatureDifference` object and a `Temperature` object (in any order) gives another `Temperature` object.\n",
    "  * Equality testing is supported; is only equal to another instance of `TemperatureDifference` with the same number of Kelvins.\n",

The string `pre` is a list of characters to be replaced when encoding, and string `post` indicates the things to replace them with.
