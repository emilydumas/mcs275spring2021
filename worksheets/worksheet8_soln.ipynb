    "Suppose you have two nodes of binary trees, given as `Node` objects from [binary.py](https://github.com/emilydumas/mcs275spring2021/blob/master/samplecode/trees/binary.py).  Let's call them `x` and `y`.  You might ask how they are related to one another, if it all.  In general, exactly one of the following statements will be true:\n",
    "1. The nodes are equal\n",
    "1. One of the nodes is an ancestor of the other\n",
    "1. The nodes lie in the same tree, but neither is an ancestor of the other\n",
    "1. The nodes do not lie in the same tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `node_relationship(x,y)` that takes two nodes and returns one of these strings:\n",
    "1. `\"equal\"`\n",
    "1. `\"ancestor\"`\n",
    "1. `\"cousin\"`\n",
    "1. `\"unrelated\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "according to which of the cases listed above describes the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the use of \"cousin\" to describe case (3) doesn't fit the genealogical analogy perfectly, as it would also include the case of siblings.)\n",
