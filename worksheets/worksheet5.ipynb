    "* Debugging Python programs using `print(...)`\n",
    "* Debugging Python programs using `pdb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main references for these topics are:\n",
    "* [Lecture 11](https://www.dumas.io/teaching/2021/spring/mcs275/slides/lecture11.html)\n",
    "* [pdb documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)\n",
    "* [pdb tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-python-debugger) from DigitalOcean\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It is important to get some practice with both worksheet topics during discussion.** Most problems are presented without any suggestion of which debugging method to use.  If you find yourself taking a long time to complete a problem using `print(...)` debugging, you might consider switching to the next one and using `pdb`.\n",
