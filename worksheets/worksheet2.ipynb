    "\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"aardvark\")` returns 1 because of the `aa` at position 0\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"space wasps---most of whom are not hostile!!\")` returns 3 because of the `--` at position 11, the `--` at position 12, and the `!!` at the end\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"the raccoon nook keepers in Mississippi cooked the books\")` returns 9\n",
    "* `double_letters_basic(\"Oolong\")` returns 0 because it has no repeated characters; the initial `O` and subsequent `o` are not the same character.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your function, put it into a script that runs in on these test strings, prints the results, and then also waits for the user to enter a string in the terminal (using `input()`) and counts double letters in that string as well."

    "* Repeated characters are ignored unless they belong to the string `letters`, which can be given as an argument, but which defaults to the letters a-z.\n",

    "* `double_letters(\"Oolong\")` returns 1 because of the double `o` at position 0\n",
