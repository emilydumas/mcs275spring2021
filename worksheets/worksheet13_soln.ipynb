    "The solution matches the problem requirement to offer a route `/superlatives/` (with a trailing slash).  It is also common to have route names that do not end with trailing slash, e.g. `/superlatives`.  It is recommended to use a trailing slash when the route is similar to a directory, in that it represents a composite object or collection, so that you might add additional subroutes later (like `/superlatives/brightest` to get just the brightness list as a HTML document), and to use no trailing slash when the resource is more like a file (a single entity with content, but having no sub-objects).\n",
