    "### 1. Learn a little more about `maze.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem involves reading and learning more about the module `maze` we discussed in Lecture 15.  You'll use the things you learn about here in subsequent problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Lecture 15](http://dumas.io/teaching/2021/spring/mcs275/slides/lecture15.html) we discussed a minimal way of using the module:\n",
    "* Create a `Maze` object (e.g. with `M = maze.Maze(xsize=7,ysize=7)`\n",
    "* Set some squares to blocked (using `M.set_blocked` for individual squares, and/or `M.apply_border` which makes all of the edge squares blocked)\n",
    "* Set the start and goal (`M.start` and `M.goal`) locations\n",
    "* Use a recursive backtracking function to find a path from the start to the goal\n",
    "The function created in the last step can be found in [solvemaze.py](https://github.com/daviddumas/mcs275spring2021/blob/master/samplecode/recursion/solvemaze.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "The module `maze` has several other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as SVG file\n",
    "\n",
    "`Maze` objects have a method `save_svg(filename)` that writes a graphical representation of the maze to a file in the SVG format.  This is a vector graphics format (scalable, not pixel-based) that can be viewed in most web browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method also accepts an optional argument `highlight`, which if given should be a list of `(x,y)` pairs that indicate squares in the maze that should be higlighted in light blue.  For example,\n",
    "```\n",
    "mymaze.save_svg(\"cool.svg\",highlight=[ (2,1), (3,1), (4,1) ])\n",
    "```\n",
    "will save the maze to `cool.svg`, and highlight three squares in blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `highlight` argument is provided as a way to indicate the solution of a maze, or any other feature you might choose to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving a maze as a PNG file\n",
    "\n",
    "For this feature, you need to install a module that isn't in Python's standard library.  The module `PIL` is from a package called *Pillow*, and is used to work with image files.  The following command should install it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m pip install pillow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Pillow, you can save a maze object as a PNG file (a bitmap graphics format supported by nearly every program that deals with images) using the `save_png` method.  Its arguments are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "save_png(filename,scale=1,highlight=[])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The argument `scale` is a positive integer controlling the width of each maze square in pixels.  The default, `scale=1`, will result in a tiny image file where each pixel is a maze square.  To get a reasonable size output image, try `scale=10` or `scale=30`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random Mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `PrimRandomMaze` inherits from `Maze` and automatically generates a random maze that has exactly one path from the start to the goal.  Its constructor takes only two arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PrimRandomMaze(xsize,ysize)\n",
    "```\n",
    "and both `xsize` and `ysize` must be **odd** numbers.  This random maze generator uses [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), which is known for producing mazes of moderate difficulty, with many short dead ends."

The constructor should create some obstacles between the start and goal, to make the maze more interesting.\n",
