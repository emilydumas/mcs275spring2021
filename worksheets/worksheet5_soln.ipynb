    "It simulates a vending machine, and is similar to a project assigned in MCS 260 in Fall 2020.  Run it, use the \"help\" command in its text interface to learn about the available commands, and try them out.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script has a bug which affects certain purchases.  For example, try starting the script and depositing \\\\$1.15 as four quarters, one dime, and one nickel, and then selecting item 4 (costing \\\\$1.10).  The expected behavior would be: The item is purchased, and \\\\$0.05 is given in change.  Instead, the script will get stuck (and may require you to press Control-C in the terminal to exit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug the program using an active debugging technique (`print(...)` or `pdb`) and find the cause of the infinite loop that prevents the program from executing as intended.  Devise and test a fix."

    "### First solution: Minimal change\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the given program stores the current credit as a float, and float addition is not exact.  For example, in Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "0.1 + 0.05 == 0.15\n",
    "```\n",
    "evaluates to `False`!  But `0.01+0.05` and `0.15` are quite close.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minimal correction to the broken vending machine program would replace a check like `cents == 0` with one that only looks for `cents` to be **near** zero, allowing for a small amount of floating point error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below does that.  It would be hard to verify the correctness of this program, however.  How do we know that the error won't accumulate over time and eventually be large enough to fail even the approximate equality test?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**In real programs, you should never use floats for financial calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "(Also, like the broken code provided in the worksheet, this patched version uses the variable name `cents` for the current credit *in dollars*.  The misleading variable name was not intentional---Professor Dumas simply forgot to change the name when he added a bug to a working version of the program.)"
