    "\n",
    "There is a new SQLite feature (or more precisely, a feature of the SQL dialect that SQLite uses for queries) that you'll need to use in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many places where we've used column names in our queries, you can also use expressions that apply arithmetic operators and other functions to the values in the columns.  For example, if a database of MCS 275 grades has columns called `project3pct` and `project4pct`, then this query would return the email addresses of students whose grades on those two projects differed by more than 10 percent:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT email FROM mcs275roster WHERE ABS(project3pct - project4pct) > 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also use expressions like this in the requested list of output columns.  For example, this query would get the average of project 3 and 4 percentages for all students, listed in alphabetical order by last name.\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT lastname, firstname, 0.5*(project3pct + project4pct) FROM mcs275roster ORDER BY lastname;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Such expressions can also be used after `ORDER BY` to make a custom sort.\n",

    "You can find lists of built-in functions in SQLite in the documentation:\n",

    "### The task\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that stores, delivers, and ranks programming jokes using a SQLite database.  It should support three operations:\n",
    "* Add a joke: The user provides a string and the program adds it to the joke table.  In addition to the joke itself, the joke table has columns to store the number of times a joke has been told, and how many times it was successful in amusing the user.\n",
    "* Tell a joke: A random joke is selected and displayed.  The user is asked if they found it amusing.  Their answer is recorded by updating the relevant counts (times told, times successful) for that row.\n",
    "* Best jokes list:  Among jokes that have succeeded at least once, display the top 5 ranked by success rate (ratio of times successful to times told).\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should create the database and table it needs if they don't already exist.  Otherwise, it should open and use the existing database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three functions should be selected using command line arguments.  The first command line argument is always the command---one of `add`, `tell`, or `best`.  If the command is `add`, then a second command line argument is required, which is the joke itself.  If the command is `tell`, no other arguments are required but the user is prompted for their approval/disapproval of the joke through keyboard input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:**\n",
    "1. Even without you asking to do so, SQLite will add an extra column to your table called `rowid` that has a distinct integer value for each row.  This is a *primary key*.  It won't return this column unless you ask for it explicitly (e.g. `SELECT * FROM ...` won't show it, but `SELECT rowid FROM ...` or `SELECT rowid,* FROM ...` will.  Having a unique id for each row is helpful so you can retrieve a row, and then apply an operation to the same row later.\n",
    "1. SQLite doesn't have a feature to select a random row directly, but it does have a built-in function `RANDOM()` that will return a random number for each row, and you order by that.\n",
    "1. In a SQLite query, if columns `A` and `B` both have type integer then `A/B` computes the *integer* division of `A` by `B`.  In contrast, `1.0*A/B` would give the true quotient because the multiplication by 1.0 converts `A` to a float (or `REAL`, in SQLite terminology).\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the program as `jokedb.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a sample session of what using it should look like. (These are from a linux terminal session, where the terminal prompt is \"$\".  In Windows PowerShell, the prompt will look a bit different.)"

    "While `mag` is a column indicating the apparent brightness of the star as seen from earth, this is not the same as the amount of light a star emits.  Some stars seem dim only because they are very far from the earth.  To account for this, the column `absmag` (absolute magnitude) indicates the brightness of the star if it were observed from a certain standard distance (about 32 light-years).  Thus `absmag` is a measure of the light energy output of the star.  Both `mag` and `absmag` use a scale where smaller numbers correspond to more light energy.\n",

Which star in the database is moving fastest, as measured by the usual length $\\| (vx,vy,vz) \\| = \\sqrt{vx^2 + vy^2 + vz^2}$?
