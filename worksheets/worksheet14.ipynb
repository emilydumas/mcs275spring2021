At first, that's fine, but you should then fix this problem as follows:\n",

    "* The URL that is the target of the +/- buttons should include a second query parameter in addition to postid, which will tell the application whether it should redirect back to `/new/` or `/top/` after updating the score.

The table of messages or posts would then refer to the user by id number, rather than storing the username.  But for this problem, you can use a simpler implementation where the table for banned users has a single column of type TEXT and acts like a persistent list of strings."
