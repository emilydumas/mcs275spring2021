Alternatively, you can use code from the solutions written by the course staff, as long as the declaration you put at the top of your program accurately explains the authorship.  Here is an example:\n",

So the Worksheet 2 program classifies a single starting value provided by the user.\n",

    "Modify the program developed in Worksheet 2 so that instead of classifying one starting value, it tries each value of `n` between `1` and `100` (inclusive) and prints what it finds for each one.
