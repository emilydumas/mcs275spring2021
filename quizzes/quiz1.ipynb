    "   * [The Python tour](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daviddumas/mcs275spring2021/blob/master/samplecode/python_tour.ipynb?flush_cache=true)\n",

    "* Select \"Quiz 1\" and upload all of your `.py` files using the dialog box that pops up.  (It allows you to upload multiple files before you hit submit, and you should do that.)\n",
    "* Read the report that is generated by the autograder, and then try to fix any tests that did not pass.  A failing test will contain a description of what went wrong, which should help you locate the problem.  If you have trouble interpreting the autograder report, reach out to the instructor or TA.\n",
