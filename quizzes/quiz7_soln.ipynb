    "* [The Python tour](https://dumas.io/teaching/2021/spring/mcs275/nbview/samplecode/python_tour.html)\n",

    "## Problem 2: Lumpsort\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that mergesort uses recursive calls to repeatedly split a list into halves until the pieces are so tiny that they are already sorted (i.e. have at most one element).  It then uses merges to build successively larger sorted lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are instead in a situation where a function `shortsort` has been provided that can sort **short** lists, but not long ones.  This can be turned into a sorting algorithm for lists of any size, which we'll call *lumpsort*, as follows:\n",
    "* If the list is short enough, call `shortsort` to sort it.\n",
    "* Otherwise, split the list in half and handle each half with a recursive call to `lumpsort`.  Then, merge the two sorted halves with `merge_sorted_lists`.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The reason I've called it \"lumpsort\" is that it only breaks a list into \"lumps\" of a certain maximum size, whereas mergesort always pulverizes a list into atoms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In a file called `quiz7prob2.py`, implement this algorithm in a function `lumpsort` with the following function definition:"
