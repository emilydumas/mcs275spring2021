This is a destructive action, so it will be protected by a layer of authentication.  Visiting `/reset/` will display a form that asks for an authentication code, and submitting that form will reset the database only if the correct code is given.  The URL that handles the submission of the form will be `/reset/confirm`, so that's the route which will contain the actual logic to check the code and reset the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this quiz, the authentication code is fixed as `481516`.  (In a real application you'd have a separate login system, and perhaps use a [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password)-based second layer of authentication for certain actions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reset form and authentication code checking functions have already been written.  All that remains is for you to write the function that receives the form data and resets the database if appropriate.  (You can either handle the reset by dropping the table and building it again, or you can delete all the rows; either is acceptable.)"
