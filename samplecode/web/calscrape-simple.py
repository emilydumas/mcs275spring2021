"""Simple scraper to convert UIC academic calendar site to CSV"""
# MCS 275 Spring 2021 Lecture 41
# Emily Dumas

# This "simple" scraper looks for the table of dates for each Spring and Fall
# semester listed at
# https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/
# and writes them to a CSV file.  Any table entry that contains a date *range*
# is ignored.  Also, in Fall 2021 there is a single date with two corresponding
# events (a deadline and a holiday). The second event is ignored by this script
# because the table has an empty date next to it (expecting it to be clear that
# the date is the same as the previous row).
