"""Scraper to convert UIC academic calendar site to CSV"""
# MCS 275 Spring 2021 Lecture 41
# Emily Dumas

# This scraper converts the session calendar tables at
# https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/academic-calendar/
# to a CSV file.  The tables contain two kinds of events:
#   * single date events, like "May 18, M. Instruction begins."
#   * date ranges, like "August 6-7, Th-F. Final examinations.""
# To represent either of these as a single row in the CSV output file, we
# include both a start date and end date for each event.  Single date events are
# then just events where start and end dates are equal.

# The calendar page also has a single table for the 4-week summer session and the
# 8-week summer session.  This scraper considers those to be separate sessions
# and marks them appropriately in the output file (as "summer4wk" and "summer8wk")

# NOTE: It would be tempting to add more processing to this scraper, e.g. to try
# to categorize events as start and end of class, holidays, deadlines, other.
# However, I think that kind of processing belongs in a separate program that
# *uses* the data generated by this scraper.  It is usually best for a scraper
# to stop when it has the minimal unambiguous structured representation of the
# source data.

# NOTE: Rather than using CSV for storage, a more natural approach would be to
# use a database with two tables: One for scrapes, and one for scraped data.
# Each time the program is run, a new scrape is generated and given an integer
# id and timestamp in the `scrapes` table.  Then, the rows of event data are
# added to the `scraped_events` table, each of them tagged with the
# corresponding scrape id.  Then, a program using the scraped data could use SQL
# queries to retrieve:
#   * the most recent scrape
#   * the first scrape
#   * all scrapes that contain an event on a certain day
#   * all dates that appear in "Instruction begins." events
#   * event dates that appear in one scrape for a certain year+semester and not
#     another, indicating a change of schedule
#   * etc.
