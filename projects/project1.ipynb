The only resources you are allowed to consult are the ones listed below.  It is very important to follow these rules.  If you are unsure about whether something is allowed, ask.  The course syllabus contains more information about the course and university policies regarding academic honesty.\n",

    "## Conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section gives a conceptual description of the project.  To actually write code, you need to read (and follow!) the precise specifications given later.  But reading this section first will probably help.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you are going to make a module containing a class hierarchy for representing and managing a list of **tasks** that a computer program needs to perform at specific times.  For this project, a task is something that might need to be done once or which might happen on a regular basis, similar to these real-world tasks:\n",
    "* Next Tuesday: Remagnetize the rain gutters\n",
    "* Every Monday for the next 15 weeks: Post the quiz\n",
    "* Every Saturday (forever): Organize sock drawer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this list you see the three basic types of tasks you'll be working with:  one-time tasks (to be represented by class `OneTimeTask`), recurring tasks that happen a fixed number of times (class `BoundedRecurringTask`), and recurring tasks that repeat forever (class `UnboundedRecurringTask`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with real world times and dates is complicated, so to avoid that becoming a huge part of this project, we'll just work with a simplified abstraction.  **Time will be a nonnegative integer**, whose meaning doesn't matter except in terms of comparisons:  Time 5 means something that happens after time 3 and before time 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to revise the examples above, this list is more tuned to the actual project specs:\n",
    "* A one time task:  At time 15, do thing X\n",
    "* A bounded recurring task: Starting at time 4, and repeating every 6 units of time until it has happened 10 times, do thing Y\n",
    "* An unbounded recurring task: Starting at time 42, and repeating every 100 units of time, do thing Z\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks will be represented by objects using classes that you are going to write.  Task objects will store a description of the task and the information about when it happens (including any recurrence data).\n",
    "\n",
    "A program that has created a task object will only be able to ask the task object to do a few things, such as\n",
    "* report when it is supposed to happen next\n",
    "* run right now (perform the work of the task)\n",
    "* \"retire\" all scheduled instances of the task up to a certain time (think of this as deleting them, or marking them as \"done\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant aspect of this design is that *task objects don't know the current time*.  That's the responsibility of the program using them.  But a program that has a bunch of task objects can do everything it needs to schedule them:  It can check when the next task needs to happen, wait for that moment, run it, and then retire it.  Then it can look again to see what needs to happen next.  A loop of this kind can ensure all the tasks run at the right times."

    "\n",
    "First, read this project description document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start working, download the [starter pack](https://dumas.io/teaching/2021/spring/mcs275/project1/proj1starterpack.zip).  It is a zip file that contains several python source files.  Extract them into the directory where you want to work on your project.  (Ask for help if you don't know how to extract a zip file in your operating system.  It is a function built-in to Windows and MacOS, and which most Linux distributions support with the tools they install by default.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, in the same directory where you extracted the starter pack, create a file called `tasks.py`.  In that file, write a module that defines five classes:\n",
    "* `Task`\n",
    "* `OneTimeTask`, a subclass of `Task`\n",
    "* `RecurringTask`, a subclass of `Task`\n",
    "* `BoundedRecurringTask`, a subclass of `RecurringTask`\n",
    "* `UnboundedRecurringTask`, a subclass of `RecurringTask`\n",
    "These classes must do exactly what is described in the section titled \"**`tasks` MODULE DOCUMENTATION**\" below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starter pack includes a few programs that try to use the `tasks` module to do things.  Of course, these programs won't work at first, because the `tasks` module doesn't exist.  But once you've built the module, you can try these programs as a basic way of testing your work.  The example programs are described in more detail in the section **Example programs** below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the example programs do not test everything! The autograder will run a different set of tests, and the only way to guarantee your work will be considered correct is to make classes that behave exactly as described in the `tasks` MODULE DOCUMENTATION section.\n",
    "\n",
