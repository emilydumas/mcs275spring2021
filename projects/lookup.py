"""
Reads a list of chromaticities and names from the CSV file
(name given as first command line argument) and provides a
lookup service using keyboard input.  Each time the user
enters a chromaticity in the format
  r g b
the name will be found and printed, or a message will be
shown indicating the chromaticity was not in the CSV file.
Entering a blank line ends the program.
