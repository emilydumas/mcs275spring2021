    "## Conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on **recursion**, both as a programming tool and as a concept that is used in mathematical definitions.  This project is also more theoretical than Project 1.  Instead of providing long and highly detailed instructions for many classes and methods, this project asks you to write just a few functions that do more complicated things.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is based on some definitions of types of strings, which were made up for this project.  You'll need to review the definitions below carefully to complete the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eggs\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this assignment, we'll say that a string is an **egg** if its length is 3, and if the last two characters are equal.  Thus:\n",
    "* `\"egg\"` is an egg\n",
    "* `\"fee\"` is an egg\n",
    "* `\"755\"` is an egg\n",
    "* `\"888\"` is an egg (no requirement that the first character is different!)\n",
    "* `\"wit\"` is not an egg (last two characters not equal)\n",
    "* `\"stratospheric\"` is not an egg (length not equal to 3)\n",
    "* `\"id\"` is not an egg (length not equal to 3)\n",
    "* `\"x\"` is not an egg (length not equal to 3)\n",
    "* The empty string is not an egg (length not equal to 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that another way to describe an egg is to say that it can be written as `A+B+B` where `A` and `B` are one-character strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "(The reason for the name is that \"egg\" is a common noun in English that is an example of this class of strings.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supereggs\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a string is a **superegg** if it is possible to write the string as a concatenation `A + B + B` where `A` and `B` are nonempty strings satisfying:\n",
    "1. `A` is either a single character or is itself a superegg, and\n",
    "1. `B` is a single character\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this definition is recursive (supereggs are defined in terms of other supereggs).  Here are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any egg is a superegg, because you can take `A` and `B` to be single characters\n",
    "* `\"abbcc\"` is a superegg, because you can write it as `A+B+B` with `A=\"abb\"` (which is an egg, and hence a superegg) and `B=\"C\"\n",
    "* `\"noooooo\"` is a superegg; it splits as `A+B+B` with `A=\"noooo\"` and `B=\"o\"`, so we just need to show that `\"noooo\"` is a superegg:\n",
    "    * `\"noooo\"` is a superegg because it splits as `A+B+B` with `A=\"noo\"` and `B=\"o\"`, and this `A` is an egg, hence a superegg.\n",
    "* `\"7225533\"` is a superegg (as you can check)\n",
    "* `\"waaa\"` is not a superegg.  If it was, then it would need to split as `A+B+B` with `A=\"wa\"`, but that is neither a superegg nor a single character.\n",
    "* `\"reconsidering\"` is not a superegg, because it doesn't end with two copies of the same character (whereas any superegg must, as `B` is a single character)\n",
    "* `\"foofee\"` is not a superegg, because it would need to split as `A+B+B` with `A=\"foof\"`, and `\"foof\"` is neither a single character nor a superegg (because it doesn't end with two copies of the same character).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypereggs\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a string is a **hyperegg** if it is possible to write the string as a concatenation `A + B + B` where `A` and `B` are nonempty strings satisfying:\n",
    "1. `A` is either a single character or is itself a hyperegg, and\n",
    "1. `B` is either a single character or is itself a hyperegg\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "* Any superegg is also a hyperegg, because you can take `B` to be a single character\n",
    "* As a special case of the example above, any egg is also a hyperegg\n",
    "* `\"fooss\"` is a hyperegg, taking `A=\"foo\"` (which is a hyperegg) and `B=\"s\"`\n",
    "* `\"alooloo\"` is a hyperegg, taking `A=\"a\"` and `B=\"loo\"` (which is a hyperegg)\n",
    "* `\"feefoofoo\"` is a hyperegg, taking `A=\"fee\"` (which is a hyperegg) and `B=\"foo\"` (which is a hyperegg)\n",
    "* `\"aseeseetoomiimiitoomiimii\"` is a hyperegg (you should check this!)\n",
    "* `\"gullability\"` is not a hyperegg, because there is no way to express it as `A+B+B` with `B` a nonempty string\n",
    "* `\"deedotdot\"` is not a hyperegg, because the only way to express it as `A+B+B` with `B` a nonempty string is to take `B=\"dot\"`, and `\"dot\"` is not a hyperegg; here's why:\n",
    "    * If `\"dot\"` were a hyperegg, then it would need to be expressed as `A+B+B` with `A` and `B` each being a single character, for otherwise the concatenation would have more than 3 characters.  But then it would follow that the last two characters are equal, which is not the case for `\"dot\"`.\n"
