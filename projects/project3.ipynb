    "## Conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chromaticities\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, a key concept will be that of a **chromaticity** or **chroma**.  We define this as an ordered triple of nonnegative integers that add up to 255.  Here are some examples of chromaticities:\n",
    "* (0,0,255)\n",
    "* (208,31,16)\n",
    "* (85,85,85)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here are some triples of integers that are NOT chromaticities:\n",
    "* (200,100,8) is not a chromaticity, because the sum is different from 255\n",
    "* (181,78,-4) is not a chromaticity, because one of the components is negative\n",
    "\n",
    "The three entries in a chromaticity have names: The first is called `r` or the **red component**.  Similarly the second component is `g` or the **green component**, and the last component is `b` or the **blue component**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most computer display technologies (like the screen you are probably looking at now) create colors by mixing varying amounts of red, green, and blue light.  Often, there are 256 possible levels of brightness for each of the three colors, indicated by an integer between 0 (no light of that color) and 255 (as much light of that color as possible).  This means that a color that can be displayed on your computer screen is typically encoded as a triple of integers between 0 and 255, e.g.\n",
    "*  <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#FF0000\"></span>  (255,0,0) is bright pure red\n",
    "* <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#000000\"></span> (0,0,0) is black \n",
    "* <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#FFFFFF\"></span> (255,255,255) is white \n",
    "*  <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#808080\"></span>  (128,128,128) is \"50% gray\"\n",
    "* <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#ffc800\"></span> (255,200,0) is orange-yellow \n",
    "* <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#9370db\"></span> (137,112,219) is a medium purple \n",
    "* <span style=\"display:inline-block; border: 1px solid black; width:1em;height:1em; background:#004000\"></span> (0,64,0) is very dark green\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, some colors are bright, and some are dim.  Generally, higher numbers mean higher brightness.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this way, **a chromaticity represents a color that has a fixed, medium brightness level**.  Working with chromaticities is a way to consider color variations without allowing differences in brightness alone.  There are many shades of pure gray, but only one \"pure gray chromaticity\", namely (85,85,85).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of chromaticity in terms of colors is not something you need to directly use in order to complete the project successfully, but it may be helpful to know the motivation behind the terminology."

    "## Chromaticity Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Having introduced chromaticities, now we'll describe a tree-based structure for storing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observation:** If you have two chromaticities that are not equal---let's call them c1=(r1,g1,b1) and c2=(r2,g2,b2)---then at least one of the following must hold:\n",
    "* r1 > r2, in which case we say c1 is **more red** than c2\n",
    "* g1 > g2, in which case we say c1 is **more green** than c2\n",
    "* b1 > b2, in which case we say c1 is **more blue** than c2\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a special feature of chromaticities, which is not true for triples of integers in general.  That is, if you don't fix the sum of the components, it's easy to make triples c1 and c2 where c1 has all of its components less than or equal to c2 (e.g. c1=(5,5,5) and c2=(10,10,10)), so that none of the conditions above holds.  But for chromaticities, the fixed sum of components means that c1 will *always* be more red, more green, or more blue than c2.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that the three conditions (more red, more green, more blue) are not mutually exclusive.  For example:\n",
    "* (30,120,105) is more green than (55,100,100), AND\n",
    "* (30,120,105) is more blue than (55,100,100)\n",
    "\n",
    "These three ways that chromaticities might compare leads to a natural way to make an object like a binary search tree to store a set of distinct chromaticies.  Each node will store a chromaticity, and will have up to three children: a **red child**, a **green child**, and a **blue child**.  These can have their own children, etc., so that below each node there is an entire **red subtree**, **green subtree**, etc.. Crucially, such a tree structure can be built so as to satisfy the following\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHROMATICITY TREE DEFINITION:**\n",
    "1. Every chromaticity in the **red subtree** of a node is **more red** than that node, and\n",
    "1. Every chromaticity in the **green subtree** of a node is **more green** than that node, and\n",
    "1. Every chromaticity in the **blue subtree** of a node is **more blue** than that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "In making pictures of such trees, I follow the convention of drawing the child nodes in the left-to-right order red, green, blue, and marking the edges with corresponding colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a chromaticity tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![chromatree example 1](chromatree-example-01.png)\n",

    "Here is another example of a chromaticity tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "![chromatree example 2](chromatree-example-02.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "(It might be worth noting that the two examples shown above contain exactly the same chromaticities, and differ only in the position of one node.  There are actually several different positions where (30,120,105) can fit into the tree, and these figures show two of them.  This is important for the algorithm that searches such a tree!)\n",

    "**Reading this section is optional.**  Having `lookup.py` use a list for a mapping like this is ridiculously inefficient, and isn't something you should ever do.  But for this project you should imagine we're thinking about a world where Python's `dict` type doesn't exist, and where we want to build an efficient mapping class adapted to the specific key type this program deals with (chromaticities).\n",
    "\n",
    "And while the tree data structure you build in this project might have certain advantages over dictionaries if we wanted to do more complex operations on the set of chromaticities (e.g. find all chromaticities close to a given one), the reality is that Python's `dict` will be faster for simple lookup operations.  That's mostly because it has been heavily optimized by the language developers, and parts of it are written in C rather than Python."
